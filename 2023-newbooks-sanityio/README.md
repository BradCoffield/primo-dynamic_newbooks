## What is this?

A little test page, with attendand CSS, that reads from Sanity.io to get "New Books" from there and display them on the the front-end. With the change to Sanity that's obviously all new but also the front-end code needed to be refactored because of various issues.

To be integrated into the library front-end.

Integrated into front-end August 2023.
